        <h5 class="card-title">Pathanamthitta</h5>
        <p class="card-text">A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.

            Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Kottayam</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Kottayam district is famous for its rich heritage and literary tradition. It is renowned for its spice and rubber trade. Cradled by the backwaters and the Western Ghats, it is epitomised by its stretches of vast greenery, paddy fields and huge rubber plantations. Over five of the State’s leading newspaper publications originate from Kottayam. About four-fifth of books published in the State come from here as well. From trekking hotbeds like Nadukani and Kottathavalam to the rare avian life on display at the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, this district encompasses everything that God’s Own Country is famous for. Well connected to the entire State, it is full of interesting historical and cultural locations that tell the tale of how the district was forged into its current form.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Ernakulam</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Ernakulam is a sprawling metropolis that beautifully combines its natural wonders with providing a base for a majority of the State’s business enterprises. Flanked by the Arabian sea, it is easily among the most visited locations in Kerala. It is an extremely important commercial centre but also has a plethora of destinations for tourists to enjoy. The city of Kochi, with its fine natural harbour, is the undisputed crown jewel of the district. From historic locations that transport you to a time when it acted as the commercial hub of the legendary Spice Route to exotic trips on boats where one can simply relax and soak in the weather, Kochi never disappoints. Ernakulam has always epitomized the Malayali spirit of welcoming all who visit it and this tradition continues to this day.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Kollam</h5>
        <p class="card-text">One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre of the country’s cashew trading and processing industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port of international spice trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to the breath-taking backwaters of Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the longest and most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. The momentous decision to introduce a new Malayalam era was convened at Kollam and hence the Malayalam calendar came to be known as kollavarsham.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Thiruvananthapuram</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Located in the southwestern tip of India, Thiruvananthapuram is bound by the Arabian Sea in the west and Tamil Nadu in the east. Named after Anantha Padmanabha or Lord Vishnu, the city is home to many ancient temples. But the landmark is the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple around which the city has been built on seven low hills. The wooded highlands of the Western Ghats in the eastern and northeastern borders give Thiruvananthapuram some of the most enchanting picnic spots. A long shoreline with internationally renowned beaches, historic monuments, backwater stretches and a rich cultural heritage make this district a much sought-after tourist destination. Clean and green, Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala is one of the most beautiful cities in the country.</p>
